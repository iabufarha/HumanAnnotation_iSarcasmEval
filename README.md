# HumanAnnotation iSarcasmEval

This repository contains human (third-party) labels of iSarcasmEval tests sets. We focused on subtasks A and C for both English and Arabic. Each file contains the original label and the aggregated label from the annotators. Each entry was annotated by five annotators. We provide the number of humans who assumed that the text is sarcastic in task A. For task C, we provide the number of votes supporting the majority label.
